Hi! This is Shuto Araki. I am a student at DePauw University studying Computer Science and Mathematics. My interests lie in Data Science, Machine Learning Security, and MLDevOps. My favorite equation is $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ and my favorite constant is Feigenbaum Constant $\delta$.

```py
print("Hello World!")
```

E = mc^2
