# Hello World!

My name is Shuto Araki. I graduated from [DePauw University](https://www.depauw.edu/) in Greencastle, IN
with majors in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor in Economics.

I started this blog to record and share my thoughts and ideas as I transition
from college to adulthood. I hope to read a lot of books and share my
intellectual journey!

<!--truncate-->

Currently, I live in Tokyo, Japan working as a Solutions Architect at Amazon Web
Services. My interests lie in Data Science, Machine Learning Security, MLOps,
and Complexity Network Theory. My passion is mathematics, especially group theory and
topology. My life goal is to figure out why [the Monster group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_group) exists.

I am also interested in Economics and Philosophy! There will be some posts on
social theories hopefully combined with some complexity theory.


## Informal remarks

Soooo I'll see how I'll go about writing articles here. I also kinda wanna keep
it informal to make it less "academic" I guess.

I just kinda miss writing out my thoughts.

## Code

```py
print("Hello World!")
```

## Equations
Classic Einstein equation
$$
E = mc^2
$$
