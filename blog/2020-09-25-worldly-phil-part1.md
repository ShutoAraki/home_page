# Motivation

In this post, I will review the book **"The Worldly Philosophers - the
lives, times, and ideas of the great economic thinkers -"** by Robert L.
Heilbroner. I bought this book a few years ago when I was in college. Professor
Barreto, my favorite professor at DePauw University, used this book as a
textbook in his *History of Economic Thought* class, which I did not get to take
during my time at DePauw.

This series of posts will summarize the book and organize my thoughts and ideas
on the historical development of economics  and philosophy of political economy.
I hope to read **Manifesto of the Communist Party** by Karl Marx and Frederick
Engels (1848) and **Capital - A Critique of Political Economy - Volume I** by
Karl Marx.
